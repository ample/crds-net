<p class="font-size-h6"><b>Fruit of the Spirit:  Growing in the Likeness of Christ</b></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is given to us when we enter into relationship with Christ.  And it is His spirit that begins to transform us into the likeness of Christ.</p>
<p>As we grow in our faith and learn obedience, the Holy Spirit begins to bear fruit causing us to look more like our Lord.</p>
<p>In this class we will learn about the nine Fruit of the Spirit and the unique qualities of each.  You will learn the things that hinders the growth of the fruit in our life and the things we can do to allow the Holy Spirit to work more freely in our lives.</p>
<p>We meet in meeting room “C”</p>
