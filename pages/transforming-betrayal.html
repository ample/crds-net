<p class="control-label"><strong>Duration</strong>: 18 weeks</p>
<p>We'll explore how to manage life in the earlier parts of discovery, seeking to understand what sexual addiction is, and supporting each other as we process. Each week we'll explore a new healing topic. Some of the topics for Part A include:</p>

<li>Coping</li>
<li>Non-negotiable boundaries</li>

<p>Monthly introduction meetings are for women who have just discovered the betrayal. Get materials to help until Part A is available to attend. Just coming to an info session does not commit you to the group.</p>
