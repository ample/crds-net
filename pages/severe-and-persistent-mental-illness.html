<p class="metadata">This support group is also known as Simon's Home, based on Luke 4:38-41</p>
<p class="lead">This is an educational, support, and growth group for any adult who has a severe and persistent mental illness, as well as for any adult who is a primary family/support person of someone who has such an illness. Weâ€™ll explore, share support, and grow in understanding and accepting these disorders and their ranges of symptoms; our experiences with them, the role and effects of medications; and additional ways to manage and reduce the intensity and frequency of symptoms. Each group meeting will include an informational presentation on some aspect of these disorders, followed by small group discussion. The group will include discussion of challenges and resources in embracing God in each of the areas in which he works in our lives: physical, mental and emotional, relational, and spiritual.</p>
