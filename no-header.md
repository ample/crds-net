A 15-cent banknote depicting Union Army generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant, dated 1866 and intended as part of the fractional currency introduced to the United States following the American Civil War. As the portraits of Sherman and Grant for this note were being finalized, Representative Martin Russell Thayer pushed forward legislation specifically stating "that no portrait or likeness of any living person hereafter engraved, shall be placed upon any of the bonds, securities, notes, fractional or postal currency of the United States". As such, the Sherman-Grant note was never issued; examples of this note exist only as specimens.
